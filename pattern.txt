 - Pattern Searching -

 To create an efficient path finding algorithm we need to set rules and define properties to highlight, by understanding the 
 common html structures we can interprete formats and code samples in seconds.
 
 Data should be read from only the start of the line, formats and code samples will compare indicating
 similiar properties which have been provided.

 - code sample -

The main module for defining the search is 're' which allows you to define formats and code samples around the area of information, 
by understanding and learning basic web structures you can create efficient searching algorithms without reading full lines of code.

*import re*

This states the pattern which will define possible lines to read/extract

pattern = "<span>(.*?)</span>\n</h1>"
              ^
    To format the algorithm correctly
    we need to state the factors before 
    and after the information, so all html 
    structures which could occur.

This searches and stores lines which have matched the pattern  
Many structures ands formats need to made to compare

title = re.search(pattern, titleFormat).group(1)
            ^                    ^
    pattern comparing   reads from source variable
